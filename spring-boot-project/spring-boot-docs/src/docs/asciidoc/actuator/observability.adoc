== Observability

Observability is the ability to observe the internal state of a running system from the outside.
It consists of the three pillars logging, metrics and traces.

For metrics and traces, Spring Boot uses https://micrometer.io/docs/observation[Micrometer Observation].
To create your own observations (which will lead to metrics and traces), you can inject an `ObservationRegistry`.

include::code:MyCustomObservation[]

NOTE: Low cardinality key-values will be added to metrics and traces, while high cardinality key-values will only be added to traces.

Beans of type `ObservationPredicate`, `GlobalObservationConvention`, `ObservationFilter` and `ObservationHandler` will be automatically registered on the `ObservationRegistry`.
You can additionally register any number of `ObservationRegistryCustomizer` beans to further configure the registry.

For more details please see the https://micrometer.io/docs/observation[Micrometer Observation documentation].

TIP: Observability for JDBC and R2DBC can be configured using separate projects.
For JDBC, the https://github.com/jdbc-observations/datasource-micrometer[Datasource Micrometer project] provides a Spring Boot starter which automatically creates observations when JDBC operations are invoked.
Read more about it https://jdbc-observations.github.io/datasource-micrometer/docs/current/docs/html/[in the reference documentation].
For R2DBC, the https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/r2dbc-micrometer-spring-boot[Spring Boot Auto Configuration for R2DBC Observation] creates observations for R2DBC query invocations.

[[actuator.observability.common-key-values]]
=== Common Key-Values
Common key-values are generally used for dimensional drill-down on the operating environment, such as host, instance, region, stack, and others.
Commons key-values are applied to all observations as low cardinality key-values and can be configured, as the following example shows:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	management:
	  observations:
	    key-values:
	      region: "us-east-1"
	      stack: "prod"
----

The preceding example adds `region` and `stack` key-values to all observations with a value of `us-east-1` and `prod`, respectively.

[[actuator.observability.preventing-observations]]
=== Preventing Observations

If you'd like to prevent some observations from being reported, you can use the configprop:management.observations.enable[] properties:

[source,yaml,indent=0,subs="verbatim",configprops,configblocks]
----
	management:
	  observations:
	    enable:
	      denied:
            prefix: false
	      another:
            denied:
              prefix: false
----

The preceding example will prevent all observations with a name starting with `denied.prefix` or `another.denied.prefix`.

TIP: If you want to prevent Spring Security from reporting observations, set the property configprop:management.observations.enable.spring.security[] to `false`.

If you need greater control over the prevention of observations, you can register beans of type `ObservationPredicate`.
Observations are only reported if all the `ObservationPredicate` beans return `true` for that observation.

include::code:MyObservationPredicate[]

The preceding example will prevent all observations whose name contains "denied".

The next sections will provide more details about logging, metrics and traces.
